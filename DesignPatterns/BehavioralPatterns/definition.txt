Behavioral patterns focus on how objects communicate and interact, managing the
flow of information between entities.
They simplify complex control flow by defining clear communication and behavior
among objects.
They provide solutions for managing object relationships and communication
protocols to promote loose coupling and enhance flexibility.


Common Applications:
● Coordinating interactions between objects.
● Managing state transitions and communication efficiently.
