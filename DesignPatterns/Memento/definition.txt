Problem: How to provide undo/redo functionality or state restoration without
exposing the object's internal state and breaking encapsulation.


Solution: The Memento Pattern captures the internal state of an object in a
memento, allowing the object to restore its state later on without revealing internal
details.


omponents:
○ Originator: The object whose state needs to be saved and restored.
○ Memento: Captures and stores the internal state of the originator.
○ Caretaker: Manages and stores the mementos, without modifying them


Undo/Redo in Applications: Commonly used in text editors, drawing applications, or
any system that requires history management.
State Restoration: Used in scenarios where you need to periodically save system
states (e.g., games, data recovery) and allow users to return to previous states.
Use Cases:
● Games: Saving the game state for load/reload functionality.
● Document Editors: Undo/redo functionality to navigate through document
changes.
